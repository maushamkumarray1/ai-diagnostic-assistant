# 🩺 AI Diagnostic Assistant for Remote Areas

This project is a **Streamlit-based AI-powered diagnostic assistant** designed to support healthcare professionals in **remote or underserved areas**. By leveraging multiple intelligent agents and Google’s Gemini language model, this tool provides an AI-driven **differential diagnosis** based on patient data such as symptoms, vitals, lab results, and medical history.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Intuitive Web Interface** built with Streamlit.
- **Multi-Agent Workflow** using [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com) for specialized medical data analysis.
- **Natural Language Diagnosis** powered by Google's Gemini model (via `litellm`).
- **Structured Diagnostic Summary** provided in both on-screen format and downloadable markdown.
- Clear, human-readable explanation of the diagnostic reasoning.
- Modular agents for:
  - Symptom analysis
  - Vital signs assessment
  - Lab report interpretation
  - Medical history evaluation
  - Follow-up recommendations

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input**: Clinician inputs symptoms, vitals, lab results, and patient history.
2. **CrewAI Agents**: The app organizes and preprocesses the data using a structured team of specialized agents.
3. **Diagnosis Synthesis**: Agents collaboratively generate a comprehensive diagnosis and suggested follow-up.
4. **User Output**: A structured diagnostic summary and explanation are displayed and can be downloaded.

Each agent has a clear medical role (e.g., Symptom Interpreter, Vital Sign Analyzer) and contributes to a shared diagnostic objective using a shared memory pipeline orchestrated by `CrewAI`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** – for UI development
- **[CrewAI](https://crewai.com/)** – to simulate a team of expert AI agents
- **[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)** – lightweight interface to use Gemini and other LLM APIs
- **Google Gemini API** – for large language model inference
- **Python** – core language for logic, orchestration, and data handling

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🧪 Add support for uploading detailed lab reports and medical images.
- 📊 Visualize diagnosis trends and graphs for better interpretation.
- 🔐 Add user authentication and patient data security layers.
- 🌍 Integrate offline capability or lightweight model for truly remote deployments.
- 🌐 Add multilingual support for better global usability.
- 📱 Package as a mobile-friendly PWA (Progressive Web App).

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- A valid [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)


### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SrujanPR/AI-Diagnostic-Assistant.git
   cd ai-diagnostic-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Add Your API Key**
   
   Replace the API key in `app.py` (GeminiLLM class) with your own [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/) API key.


5. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   
6. **Sample Input**

   - Symptoms: swelling in legs, fatigue, reduced urine output, nausea
   - Body Temperature: 98.7
   - Blood Pressure: 145/95
   - Pulse Rate: 88
   - Lab Results: Creatinine 3.5, BUN 52, Hb 9.8
   - History: diabetes, hypertension
  
   When you enter these inputs and run the program one of the probable diagnosis should be Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) as these are the symptoms of CKD.
